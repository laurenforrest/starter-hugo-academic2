Transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people (referred to below using the umbrella term of "trans") have always existed. For as long as major population-level surveillance has existed, trans people have also always had disproportionately high rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. But trans people are severely under-represented in the suicide literature, meaning that we don't understand nearly enough about the factors that contribute to trans people thinking about or attempting suicide.

Our lab believes that--especially in the current sociopolitical environment--more must be done to study and prevent suicide in trans people. This study is hoping to put a dent in that aim. We're researching what processes contribute to trans people thinking about suicide at a momentary timescale. In other words, we're not studying what things might increase suicide risk over months or years. We're studying what things might increase suicide risk over moments or days.
