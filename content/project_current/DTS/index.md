Transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people (referred to below using the umbrella term of "trans") have always existed. For as long as major population-level surveillance has existed, trans people have also always had disproportionately high rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. But trans people are severely under-represented in the suicide literature, meaning that we don't understand nearly enough about the factors that contribute to trans people thinking about or attempting suicide.

Our lab believes that--especially in the current sociopolitical environment--more must be done to study and prevent suicide in trans people. This study is hoping to put a dent in that aim. We're researching what processes contribute to trans people thinking about suicide at a momentary timescale. In other words, we're not studying what things might increase suicide risk over months or years. We're studying what things might increase suicide risk over moments or days.

**A quick note on the current sociopolitical environment:** This research project is not intended to be political. We're studying a devastating public health problem in a population that (1) has very high prevalence of that public health problem and (2) has rarely been represented in the research on that problem. But in these 2025 times, researching any health outcome in trans people (or LGBTQ+ people broadly) suddenly *is* political. We (sadly) suspect that over the next few years, more trans people will think about suicide, attempt suicide, and die by suicide than ever before. Here's why:

In the first two weeks of Donald Trump's second presidency, he isssued [five Executive Orders directly targeting trans people](https://www.hrc.org/news/understanding-executive-orders-and-what-they-mean-for-the-lgbtq-community). These Orders reduce access to affirming medical care and reduce availability of affirming environments for trans people. As the months have ticked on, trans people's rights have continued to be a major focus of state and federal legislation, where the enacted laws and rulings almost exlusively reduce trans rights. Science is incredibly clear that such actions are associated with more frequent and severe suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 

Moreover, political and ideological priorities are infiltrating the US scientific infrastructure, who is the country's major funder of suicide risk and prevention research. The National Institutes of Health [illegally terminated](https://www.science.org/content/article/judge-orders-nih-restore-hundreds-grants-cut-under-trump) hundreds of research grants studying [health outcomes in LGBTQ+ people](https://projects.propublica.org/nih-cuts-research-lost-trump/), including a grant that funds our lab's work. The grants weren't terminated because of investigator misconduct or because the health outcomes the grants were studying weren't important. The grants were terminated because they were specifically studying LGBTQ+ people. 

The National Institutes of Health is now screening grant applications for now-banned words or topics, meaning that those grants are not scientifically reviewed and therefore cannot be funded. LGBTQ+-related terminology and topics are among the many banned words or topics. These actions deprive LGBTQ+ people from research and treatment innovations. At best, depriving LGBTQ+ people from research and treatment innovations will keep trans peoples' health disparities at their current status quo, which in the case of suicide means trans people being up to 9x more likely than cis people to experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors. At worst, depriving LGBTQ+ people from research and treatment innovations will make trans peoples' health disparities even steeper.

We are doing this study--right now--because we want to understand whether and how trans people who have experienced suicidal thoughts and behaviors specifically, in addition to LGBQ people who have experienced suicidal thoughts and behaviors, are being affected by the current sociopolitical context. 

We are a small and new-ish research lab. We don't have the funds or people power to collect population-level data or to tackle the many ways we think trans people or LGBTQ+ people overall will be harmed by recent legislation. But we do have funds, people power, and expertise to study momentary suicide risk processes in LGBTQ+ people, and we can study those processes both in LGBQ people specifically and among trans people specifically. So we're doing what we can with what we have to conduct rigorous science that will hopefully help contribute to knowledge that will ultimately, some day reduce suicide in trans people and the LGBTQ+ community overall.
