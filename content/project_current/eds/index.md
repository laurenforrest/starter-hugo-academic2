I have several ongoing projects that use advanced quantitative methods to better understand eating disorder outcomes. One set of projects takes an intersectional approach to quantifying eating disorder disparities. One study assesses the prevalence of eating disorder behaviors at the intersection of gender and race, and another study assesses prevalence of eating disorder behaviors at the intersection of gender and sexual orientation. These studies can advance our field by (1) understanding the intersectional groups most at risk for eating disorder outcomes and (2) shifting intervention targets away from individual-level processes and toward root causes of health disparities (i.e., sexism, homophobia, racism).

Another set of projects uses data mining to (1) better define eating disorder severity and (2) empirically determine optimal frequency cutoffs to differentiate anorexia nervosa subtypes.

These advanced quantitative methods hold a lot of promise for advancing suicide research, as well.

**Note.** Each of these studies uses previously-collected data that belong to my collaborators.
