The term "multifinality" means that the same risk process might impact multiple, distinct outcomes. Given my research focus on comorbidity and multivariate approaches, it is probably not surprising that I also have interest in identifying transdiagnostic risk factors for psychopathology. 

Much of my work in this area has studied interoceptive impairment in relation to suicide.  Interoception is the perception of the physiological condition of the body. Interoception is what allows people to sense their emotions, their heartbeats, and their hunger and fullness, for example. Interoceptive impairment has long been noted among people with eating disorders. Interoceptive impairment may exacerbate eating disorder symptoms because being out of touch with one’s body and sensations might promote—and/or reduce a barrier to—behaviors that damage the body. 

This logic seemed like it may also apply to suicidal behavior, and I therefore led the first study, and numerous follow-up studies, on interoceptive impairment in suicide. Overall, this line of work determined that reduced interoceptive abilities may be a novel correlate of self-injurious
thoughts and behaviors.

**Example questions I tackle within this area include:**
1. How does impaired interoception relate to suicidal thoughts and behaviors?
2. How does interoception become impaired?
3. How can interoception be improved, and does improving interocpetion result in less suicidal thoughts and behaviors and/or less eating disorder symptoms?
