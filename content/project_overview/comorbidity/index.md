Eating disorders and suicide often co-occur, have similar risk factors, and can serve similar functions. Beyond the eating disorder - suicide overlap, I also conduct projects related to comorbidity, in general, and dimensional classification. 

**Example questions I tackle within this research area are:**
1. Why do eating disorders and suicide co-occur at such high rates?
2. What factors influence both eating disorders and suicide?
3. Do psychiatric comorbidities impact eating disorder treatment outcomes?

**Example papers within this content area include, but are not limited to:**
