Sarah was my lab's research coordinator at Penn State College of Medicine. She is currently a graduate student in Personality, Individual Differences, and Behavior Genetics at the University of Minnesota. She is interested in using data to inform real-world psychopathology conceptualization, treatment and prevention, especially for people in underserved communities.
