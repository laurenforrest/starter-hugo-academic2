Ayla Gioia, PhD is a postdoctoral fellow at the NYU Langone Military Family Center. Ayla’s research focuses on (1) bridging the gap between eating disorder research and practice by examining clinicians’ experiences implementing empirically supported treatments in real-world settings and (2) examining shared mechanisms underlying eating disorders and self injurious thoughts and behaviors. 

Ayla and I began working together after being matched through the Academy for Eating Disorders' Early Career Special Interest Group Mentee-Mentor program. We were matched in 2021 and have worked together ever since!

**Ayla's papers and projects in my lab include:**

***Gioia, A. N.***, **Forrest, L. N.**, & Smith, A. R. (2022). Diminished body trust uniquely predicts suicidal ideation and nonsuicidal self-injury among people with recent self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. *Suicide and Life-Threatening Behaviors, 52*, 1205–1216. 

Billman, M. G., ***Gioia, A. N.***, Essayli, J., & **Forrest, L. N.** (in press). Few differences in psychiatric comorbidities and treatment response in people with anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa. *International Journal of Eating Disorders.*

Gehman, S., ***Gioia, A. N.***, Dodd, D. R., & **Forrest, L. N.** (under review). Do the symptoms that link perfectionism and disordered eating change throughout the course of a perfectionism intervention?
