Griffin is a first-year clinical psychology doctoral student whose research aims to predict and prevent acute mental health crises. Griffin is particularly interested in leveraging ambulatory assessment and idiographic analytical methodology to better capture each individual's real-time experiences and build personalized predictive models. Ultimately, his goal is to develop just-in-time adaptive interventions that can be used to detect an impending crisis and successfully intervene before it occurs. In his free time, Griffin loves to attend music festivals, add to his reading list, and play Dungeons and Dragons.
