She graduated from Amherst College with a double major in Psychology and American Studies and then spent several years working as a management consultant prior to completing her master's degree in psychology at San Diego State University. Haley's research interests focus on better understanding why eating disorders develop and persist, ultimately looking towards improving eating disorder treatment efficacy and minimizing relapse rates.
