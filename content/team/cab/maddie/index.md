Hi, I'm Maddie. I'm a member of the LGBTQ community in North Carolina and I'm passionate about fighting for queer rights and visibility everywhere, but especially in our healthcare system! I joined the Board because I believe that suicide prevention in the queer community specifically is a critical issue that has not been researched enough. As someone with experience in that area, it's important to me to help by lending my voice and perspective, and I'm hoping that my contribution to this study will improve mental and emotional health support for the LGBTQ community.
