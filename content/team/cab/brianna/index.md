Hi, I'm Brianna! I love dance, traveling, cooking, spending time with my family, and learning anything I can about a wide variety of topics! My favorite insect is the ant 🐜. I joined this advisory board in the hopes that I can use my lived experience to help advance research and scientific understanding of how suicide impacts people like me, in order to hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future.
