**I am ***likely*** accepting a clinical psychology PhD student** to begin at the University of Oregon in **Fall 2025** (meaning I'll review applications that are submitted 12/2024). I'll post an official decision as soon as possible!

This section contains important info for prospective students potentially interested in joning the lab. For information on the University of Oregon's APA- and PCSAS-accredited clinical psychology PhD program, click [here](https://psychology.uoregon.edu/research/clinical-area).<br><br> Best of luck with the application process, and I genuinely look forward to reviewing your application! <br><br>
