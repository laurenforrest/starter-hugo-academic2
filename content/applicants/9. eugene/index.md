The University of Oregon is located in Eugene, Oregon. While I'm not a Eugene expert yet, below is a bit of Eugene info. I'll update this page with more info over time.

1. Eugene has a lush and green landscape. It's a dream location if you're into mountains, hiking, and/or nature. I took the pic above from Spencer Butte (a popular Eugene hiking spot) in January 2023. Not too bad for January weather!<br><br>

2. Eugene is roughly a 1-hour drive to the coast (driving west) and very large mountains (driving east). Eugene is roughly a 2-hour drive to Portland (driving north).<br><br>

3. If proximity to a Trader Joe's impacts your quality of life, as it does mine, there is a Trader Joe's in Eugene!<br><br>

4. See highlights [here](https://viewbook.uoregon.edu/eugene) on Eugene as a city, including info on weather, food, arts, culture, and outdoor activities.<br><br>

5. The University of Oregon has a [Campus Pride Index](https://campusprideindex.org/campuses/details/119?campus=university-of-oregon) of 5/5, which is "an overall indicator of institutional commitment to LGBTQ-inclusive policy, program, and practice."
