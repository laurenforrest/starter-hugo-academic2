Conducting studies using previously-collected data is a great way to learn more analyses and get more experience with publishing. Granted, if you’re collecting data independently you have full control over the data, but this also takes so much time. There are lots of datasets out there that are publicly available or that I have connections to and could request access to the data for you. There are also datasets that will stem from in-progress studies that you’d have access to as a student.

**Publicly available data (list is not exhaustive)**
1. National Survey on Drug Use and Health
2. National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions 
3. National Comorbidity Survey Replication (though these data are quite dated by this point)

**Lab datasets**<br>
*Note.* All my datasets include both eating disorder & suicide data.

1. Ecological momentary assessment data on suicide risk processes in rural adults

2. Short-term suicide predictor systematic review data

3. Self-report and psychophysiological measures from roughly 55 people with past nonsuicidal self-injury and/or suicide attempts

4. More to come!
