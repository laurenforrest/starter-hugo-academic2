Marley is a first-year doctoral student in clinical psychology at Auburn University. Before grad school, she served as the clinical research coordinator for the Division of Adolescent Medicine at the Penn State College of Medicine. Marley and I began working together while we were both at PSU. Marley's research primarily explores individual differences in the development and maintenance of disordered eating and how intersectionality may impact response to treatment.
