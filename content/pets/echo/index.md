**Echo** (aka Eggie) is an 11-year old pit bull-bull dog mix. He's loving, gentle, and a complete diva. He insists on being tucked in at night with the softest, plushest blankets. He loves snuggling and laying his entire body on top of his humans. He regularly huffs at me if I'm not catering to his needs in that moment. He is truly hilarious.
