**Lila** (aka LaLa) is a 2-ish year old pitbull mix (staffie maybe?). She was living on the streets, then rescued, then sadly at the rescue for 4 months with no families showing interest in her. I saw a video of her online and knew we had to meet her. She has some strong stranger danger but once she warms up to you, she is pure joy, silliness, and exuberance. When I get home from work, she greets me like I've been gone for weeks, not hours. When she's feeling really big emotions, she gives adorable love nibbles. Her favorite things in life are playing with toys in the yard and making her humans feel loved. She is a very special creature.
