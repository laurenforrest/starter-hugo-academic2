**Mac** (aka Misty) is a 10.5-year-old border collie-lab mix. Mac is  chill and doesn't get excited by too many things. However, he is pretty excitable when it comes time for his daily walk and his daily treats. He is incredibly affectionate and regularly interrupts my work by placing his head on my lap and nudging my arm for loves...consistently and persistently. He's my soul dog and I love him to pieces.
