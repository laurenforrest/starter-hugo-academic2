**Jax** (aka Jiggy) is a 7.5-year old hound-lab mix. Jax was 1.5 years old when we adopted him. His life pre-adoption was short but really rough, and destroyed his implicit trust in humans. Over 6 years of solid behavioral training with us, Jax still sometimes has intense anxiety and behavioral problems, but we have also built trust and safety. He loves our daily walks, loves to roll down hills (literally scooting himself down hills on his back, it's so funny), loves sleeping near his humans, and feels safe enough to seek out and enjoy some prolonged ear rubs. Huge milestones for this pup!
