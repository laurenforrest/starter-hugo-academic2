On 11/18/24, we said goodbye to Jax. It was unfortunately but unequivocally his time to go. But that didn’t and doesn’t make it any harder to not have him physically with us. Jax’s goals in life were to feel safe and loved. We loved him dearly and protected him fiercely. He loved eating food, shredding paper products (he especially loved paper towels), going on walks, scratching his back on grass, and being near his humans at all times. He passed in the comfort of his home (thanks to an unbelievably stellar veterinary team) and while enjoying the most prolonged belly rubs of his life. He will always be our Jaxie, Jiggy, Gingy, GiGi boy. We love you, buddy.
