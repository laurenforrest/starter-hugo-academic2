Jax was born in April 2016. We adopted him in June 2017. Although Jax's pre-adoption life was short, he experienced things no dog should ever have to experience, which left indelible marks on our Jiggy boy. Jax’s goals in life were to feel safe and loved. We protected him fiercely and loved him dearly for 7.5 years. On 11/18/24, we said goodbye to Jax. It was unfortunately but unequivocally his time to go. But that didn’t and doesn’t make it any easier to not have him physically with us. 

Jax loved eating food, shredding paper products (he especially loved paper towels), going on walks, scratching his back on grass, and being near his humans at all times. He passed in the comfort of his home, thanks to an unbelievably stellar veterinary team, and while enjoying the most prolonged belly rubs of his life. 

Jax, you will always be our Jaxie, Jiggy, Gingy, GiGi boy. We love you, dude.
